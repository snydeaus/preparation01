I had taken a class called "Writing & Rhetoric" during my freshman year of college at Olivet College. We had to write an argumentative essay. My topic that I chose was about zoos. In this essay, I explained the pros and cons of zoos. I am not for zoos, however I am not completely against them. In this essay, I had many points of why zoos are not beneficial to wild animals. However, the grading rubric had a limit on words. I understand that having a limit of word count will keep writers from going off-topic rather than hitting the main points. Unfortunately, I had to take out a couple of main points from my essay because it caused me to exceed the word limit. After receiving my poor grade for this essay, I was obviously upset. My dilemma was, get points taken off for not gaving enough evidence to back up my argument, or have points taken off for exceed the word limit. There was nothing that I could do, but despite my poor letter grade, I still felt very knowledgable on the topic of zoos. 
Although I do not always agree, I believe that grades represent the knowledge of that specific assignment, unit, test, class, etc. There are times where I felt that I had complete knowledge of an assignment however I did not receieve that grade I thought I deserved. However, there are also many times where I feel that I did not deserve to have a good grade because I would do the bare minimum to "get an A". I do agree that grades create a preference for the easiest possible task, specifically when the class does not interest me. In math classes, whenever I get a final answer I always ask myself, "does this answer make sense?" However, with a Gen Ed class for example, I get an answer and move on because I do not care to learn it and just care about passing the class with an A.
